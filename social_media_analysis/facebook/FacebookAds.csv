American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage that is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms take another level of hate.

409,"Cornel West on Obama: ""The First Black President Has Become The First Niggerized Black President""        Reacting to President Obama's use of the n-word on Marc Maron's podcast, Cornel West called him the first ""niggerized"" president in an appearance on CNN. West criticized Obama as ""a person who is afraid and intimidated when it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy."" ""A niggerized black person is a black person who is afraid and scared and intimidated when it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy and fighting against white supremacy,"" West explained. ""So when many of us said we have to fight against racism, what were we told? 'No, he can't deal with racism because he has other issues, political calculations. He's the president of all America, not just black America.' We know he's president of all America but white supremacy is American as cherry pie."" West is right as usual. African minorities would choose Mr. West in 2009 and 2012 instead of Obama. But we had no choice. Cornel is a good leader, he knows what black community is suffering from. Obama was promoted by big corporations owned by white people. Obama never tried to protect blacks from police pressure, never tried to stop police violence against blacks.

410,"Autopsy Says Freddie Gray Died After Sustaining 'High-Energy Injury' in Police Van        The Baltimore state medical examiner's office has found that Freddie Gray likely died from a single ""high-energy injury"" sustained as he rode shackled in the back of a police van on the day of his arrest, according to an autopsy report obtained by the Baltimore Sun. The autopsy report suggested that Gray may have attempted to stand up during the van ride, and that the injury could have occurred as he was thrown against the van wall when the vehicle changed direction. Like really? When police took Gray to the hospital, doctors determined that he had sustained a severed spine and crushed voice box. High-energy injury? We don't think so. It's hard to believe.

Consequently, the victim's skin color plays a crucial role in deciding what kind of punishment he will receive. For instance, you are more likely to be sentenced to death if you have killed a white person. Frankly speaking, if the government wants to keep the country away from the summer urban riots, then they must think about the living standards of black population that is several times below the living standards of white people in America.

429,"Sadness and shocking tragedy at historically black church in Charlestone        A white gunman opened a fire at pastor and 8 other church members at black church in Charlestone, S.0 on Wednesday night. The young clean-shaved shooter walked in during a prayer meeting and started shooting the people. Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said that the incident would be investigated as hate crime. Emanuel AME Church is a historically Africa-American church which was found by Denmark Vesey in order to organize a slave revolt in 1822. Despite the first black American president, Africa-Americans remain the most common victims of hate crimes. But what if the hate crime relates to xenophobia? American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage that is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms take another level of hate. Unfortunately, American tolerance is not what we think it is. US public is swapping patriotism for nationalism, tolerance for Islamophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. For instance, last February American gunman killed three young Muslims two miles away from the University of North Carolina campus. Was this gunman motivated by hate and intolerance? Should we expect for more hate-crimes? What if American racial change still occurs through generations? What of it racism happens due to unequal opportunities?

It's strange to hear it from the man who supported 2nd amendment earlier. The lack of clear-cut opinion is very bad character trait. However, it doesn't matter. The right to bear arms is inalienable right of Americans that was given us by the Founding Fathers. The 2nd amendment guarantees private safety of the people. The right to keep and bear arms has been recognized as existing prior even to the creation of a written national constitution. The govermmnet should respect the 2nd amendment and the law in general.

Let's take a look at just how crazy this pledge gets.       That's just nuts! They want candidates to support a constitutional amendment to ban marriage nationwide. This will never happen. For the last decade public support for marriage equality has gone from 35 percent to 55 percent! But they don't stop there. NOM also wants candidates to ""work to overturn any Supreme Court decision"" in favor of the freedom to marry. NOM wants the president to only nominate judges who will uphold marriage bans, but at this point, legal consensus so strongly supports marriage equality that supporting marriage bans is a sign that person isn't qualified to be a judge. Also, NOM wants the candidates to weaken civil rights laws, creating loopholes to let companies and citizens to discriminate if they cite a religious justification. That could actually happen â€” and it already has in some states â€” so it's a huge concern. And fifth, they want the Department of Justice to investigate harassment against people who oppose marriage equality. Sure, gays and lesbians are harassed every day, fired, kicked out of their homes and schools, separated from their families, but I really hope soon there'll be NO MORE of it!

Jeanie Miller, whom Williamson had been living with, said that Vallum knew that Williamson was transgender. Modern America is too dangerous for transgenders. This is the ninth transgender killing based on gender identity. According to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs' report hate-motivated violence against transgenders rose 13%. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to live as a transgender in the South. Alabama even passed a religious freedom law in 1998 that allows discrimination against LGBT people. That also allows lawmakers to justify hostility toward transgender people. And that we call `freedom'?

Yet despite his solid performance and commitment to serve, SGT Ortega has been at risk of getting kicked out of the Army because in official Army paperwork, he is identified as a woman. But the real warriors never surrender! Ortega struggled for the equal rights for the transgender people in the military. And he succeeded!

Just wanted to see if you could share my coming out as trans story on  your page. I have been on a long, rough journey to this point and I think my  story could help younger trans youth see that no matter how bad it gets it  always gets better. I would really appreciate this because I want to become  someone who inspires the LGBT community to be themselves!  Ever since I was little, I knew I was different. I wasn't like any of the other  kids. I had a unique way of thinking and often that left me isolated. Something  I still feel the sting of today. Unlike most boys who played with Spiderman and  Superman action figures when they were little, I played with barbies ... I  wanted to look like them. I wanted to be them. It felt right playing with these  dolls. I had to hide when I did it though because even at an early age, I knew  boys weren't supposed to play with dolls. Once I had gotten got caught by  my grandmother's ex husband and he told me to put them away and stop  being a sissy ....

114,"Man Dies After Police Use Pepper Spray During Arrest In Alabama        A man in Alabama collapsed and died after officers sprayed him with pepper spray while arresting him after a chase, Tuscaloosa police said Saturday. Police said Ware ran into nearby woods and struggled with officers when they caught up with him. Officers sprayed him with oleoresin capsicum, more commonly known as pepper spray, according to police. The chemical agent debilitates a person by causing temporary blindness and irritating a person's nose and throat. The six officers who were involved in Ware's case will remain on duty during an investigation, according to police. Officials said police car dash cam and body camera footage of the incident would be released after that investigation. This tragedy happen accidentally, and probably the police officers didn't wish death upon him, because they tried to give him first aid. However, the man is dead and there is no chance to rewind and bring him back. He's gone forever, but the cops will remain on duty and get away with this murder. Is this acceptable?

118,"Ta-Nehisi Coates on growing up in West Baltimore        The famous African-American writer Ta-Nehisi Coates grew up in West Baltimore with people who lost a child whether to the streets, to guns or to jail. Today, his goal is to protect his son from the different forms of violence that he experienced in school and on the streets. People of color have been dealing with injustice ever since they crossed the North American continent. For instance, in West Baltimore, Ta-Nehisi was trained not to go to the neighborhoods unless you know this place. He was told that you cannot tolerate anybody attempting any physically violent threat to you. Moreover, his mom was feared that her children would get arrested. What does it mean? Undoubtedly, black Americans were afraid of police, improper procedure, injustice or what is worse, being killed by police officer. That's why the nationwide furor over the growing number of unarmed black men fatally shot by police officers has put the public on a new trend in America.

""Black features are beautiful, black women are not,"" Stenberg wrote. ""White women are paragons of virtue and desire, black women are objects of fetishism and brutality. This, at least, seems to be the mentality surrounding black femininity and beauty in a society built upon eurocentric beauty standards."" Everybody knows that racism is alive and prospering in America. However, all the news about killing black men and black teenagers, police brutality, unfair sentences and other issues, distract us from the fact that black women are being abused in the most violent ways.

Cleveland Municipal Court Judge Ronald Adrine in June found probable cause for Officer Timothy Loehmann, who shot Rice, and his partner, Frank Garmback, to face charges in the shooting. Loehmann shot Rice twice within seconds of arriving outside a city recreation center on Nov. 22 in response to an emergency call of a man with a gun. Rice, who was playing with an Airsoft-type replica handgun that shoots pellets, died the next day. By any means the justice system is trying to justify the cops, who should've been never employed even. They shot the poor kid in 2 seconds after they arrived, not even having time to understand the situation. Everyday police use excessive force and weapons against unarmed people. Killers in uniform...

Not seven years ago, her teenage daughter was accidentally shot to death. This time, a firearm in the hand of her son, Brandon Claxton, 16, prompted an officer to shoot him three times about 7:15 p.m. Saturday in a housing complex in the 2500 block of Hodiamont Avenue, officials said. Police encountered him while responding to a call about someone with a stolen pistol. His mother said that she respected the police and that her son ""shouldn't have had the gun."" But from what witnesses have told her, she said, ""They didn't have to shoot him down like that."" One of three witnesses interviewed Sunday told a reporter that Brandon did have a gun in his hand. But all three said that he did not point a weapon at anyone as he tried to run from officers. When a white guy walks around with a rifle, nobody bats an eye.

125,"90-year-old WWII veteran is evicted on stretcher. The WWII veteran Johnnie H. Hodges refused to leave his house after he was not able to pay his mortgage while caring for his sick wife. Police and ambulance workers had to carry him away on a stretcher. A 90-year-old Navy veteran lived in his Buffalo home with his wife for decades. But about four years ago; he was taking care of his wife, who had Alzheimer's disease and spent all his income on her rehabilitation. In the process, he defaulted on his mortgage and amassed a huge debt totaling $73;000 to M&T Bank. Unfortunately, due to his default on his mortgage loan payments, he was evicted from his house on a stretcher. Why does the U.S. government treat military veterans absolutely disgracefully? Why the WWII veterans are literally being treated like human garbage by their own government? How potentially disabled veteran was evicted from his house? How come homelessness and unemployment among American veterans is much higher today than for the general population of the United States of America?",10,28,Male,18 - 65+,07/17/15 06:33:04 AM PDT,07/19/15 06:33:04 AM PDT,https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/,"Living In: United States: Baltimore Maryland: Ferguson, St. Louis Missouri; Cleveland Ohio",,News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices,People who like Black Matters.,,,Friends of people who are connected to Black Matters,,,,,,8.85,RUB,/2015-07/P(1)0001912.pdf,2015-q3.zip,1,,,,,

130,"'We want our chief back'        Last week, in a place that bills itself as the ""Friendliest Town on the Eastern Shore,"" angry residents marched to City Hall, demanding to give back a job for Kelvin Sewell, the community's first black police chief. On June 29 he was fired amid allegations leveled against white officers of departmental racism. After that the crowd of Sewell's supporters moved to voice their outrage to the Pocomoke City Council with posters that read ""We Support Chief Kelvin Sewell."" As a nation we have looked the other way for far too long and it is disgraceful! This time we're not fighting with police, we're fighting for justice.

131,"Made In The US: The Justice Turns Into Business For years, inmates with non-violent felonies and misdemeanor charges in New York City had to sit in Rikers Island for months awaiting trial, 'cause they couldn't afford to pay bail. Under the city's new bail initiative announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio last week, some 3,000 low-level offenders are eligible for release without bail. The system needs serious reform. According to the New York Police Department, the biggest part of arrests are low-level offenses like peeing on the street or disorderly conduct. The New York Daily News reports that 81 percent of the 7.3 million people hit with summonses between 2001 and 2013 were black and Hispanic. So what should we do? The criminal penal system is antiquated. It should be changed. The worse, it is now designed to be for profit which has led to laws being designed to keep people in prison, rather than rehabilitating. More and more it looks like it's a business. The first rule of any society is development. At such rate the US government will start to sell indulgences soon. Our system is not only unfair, but also corrupt! We should explore alternative solutions and limit the number of people in prison to the most violent and potentially dangerous offenders. Only real criminals should be in jail! Lemme ask you, have you ever seen a one of the tobacco industry executives go to jail? I guess no. We also have never seen the Bush or any other Presidents administrations were brought to justice. America has a justice system that was supplanted the Jim Crow laws as a means to keep the minorities from developing real opportunities for keeping the very rich from ever being brought to justice.",109,1426,Male,18 - 65+,,,https://www.facebook.com/Black-Matters-1579673598947501/,"Living In: United States: Baltimore Maryland; Ferguson, St. Louis Missouri; Cleveland Ohio",,News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices,"People who like Black Matters,",,,Friends of people who are connected to Black Matters,,,,,,364.87,RUB,/2015-07/P(1)0001918.pdf,2015-q3.zip,2,,,,,

The second case over a week, huh? How retarded and/or brainwashed by Fox News is one supposed to be to believe this is a coincidence? No way we are gonna buy such bullshit. The weirdest thing about this specific case is that the suicide was committed just an hour after the arrest. Moreover, the woman was suspected of stealing someone's phone which is quite not a reason for getting to her account.

Amari Brown, a 7-year-old boy on the city's West Side, was the youngest of the fatalities. Those 30 shootings came between 9:20 p.m Saturday and 4:45 a.m. Sunday. Amari had spent the day celebrating with family and riding his scooter up and down the block where he lived with his grandmother and several other relatives in Humboldt Park. Just before midnight, a gunman opened fire outside a relative's home where Amari and other children were playing, hitting both the 7-year-old and a 26-year-old woman in the chest. No arrests have been made. Family members will hold a press conference Sunday afternoon to call for Amari's killer to turn himself in. How can we feel safe here in America?

435,"A number of refugees has increased since Obama became the President        States across the country were filled with flows of refugees since Obama became the President. The U.S. refugee admissions database wrapsnet.org states that 437,829 new refugees came to the USA since Obama first took office. Most of them were placed in Texas (46,351), California (44,162) and New York (26,293). Many of refugees were placed in Ohio (14,855), Florida (21,613), Virginia (9,395), Colorado (11,300) and Nevada (3,421). Such active provision of a shelter for refugees sooner or later will lead to the fact that the number of terrorist attacks in the USA will increase. The US Homeland Security Committee considers that the administration is admitting too many refugees from Iraq and Syria, a hotbed of ISIS terrorism. Perhaps new terrorist attacks won't be so large as the 9/11 but there will be more terrorist attacks if the immigration policy won't be tightened.

448,"The Census Bureau published the new data in its International Data Base, which contains population estimates and projections up to the year 2050. The figure from the Census Bureau is a calculation of net migrationâ€”meaning the total number of immigrants who will arrive in the United States in 2015 would actually be larger than 1.24 million.        Of course, the United States is the country of immigrants. But if America had huge undeveloped lands and needed workers at the earliest stage, today there is a jobs deficit. Today the government must restrict immigration that is a reason of interethnic tensions in the United States. High unemployment rate fuels intolerance toward immigrants that are ready to work illegally for low wages. So, besides social problem, immigrants threaten the U.S. economy. Those who work illegaly don't pay taxes that are an important part of state budget. Working illegaly, they break the law. Lack of immigration restrictions increases crime rates. Moreover, more and more immigrants cannot speak English. One-fifth of people in the United States speak a foreign language at home, according to a report of the Center for Immigration Studies. You see, increasing ammount of immigrants in the United States creates social and economic problems. However, we have a risk not only to worsen the U.S. economy, but also to lose our culture. America can't be the Tower of Babel, we cannot allow everybody to live here if immigration threatens us. We don't hate foreigners, we are glad to see tourists from every corner of the world, but we cannot allow them to stay here.

510,"A terrorist attack was conducted at two U.S. military sites in Chattanooga Mohammad Youssef Abdulazeez was shot and killed by police after he attacked two military sites in Chattanooga, Tennessee and killed four U.S. Marines at the Navy Operational Support Center and Marine Corps Reserve Center. Authorities say a man was a practicing Muslim. At present FBI is conducting an investigation. According to his beliefs, Mohammad was a fundamental Islamist. Having examined after his death his social pages, FBI has found that he kept a blog and had a note where he said that he conducted a terrorist act in obedience to Allah. It is notable that the terrorist attack was conducted in the last day of Ramadan. It is noteworthy that in his letter the terrorist didn't refer to ISIS or AI-Qaeda; he acted in his own volition. We don't want to stir up Islamophobia, but if such manifestations of Islam have place, it is very sorrowful for the United States. The situation in the Middle East and the extensive propaganda of ISIS make ordinary Muslims to become radical Islamists and take the path of war and death. If people on their own commit such attacks, the American society must take it more seriously. The society should develop a new behavioral model towards Islam, according to which, on the one hand Muslims and Christians will live comfortable together.

President Obama hasn't ordered to lower a flag, though a federal law states that the flag shall be flown at half-staff upon the deaths of principal figures or the governor can lower the US flag in his or her state following the deaths of officials or members of the US Army. By contrast, Obama ordered the flags to half-staff following on the same day that as the shootings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. The flag was lowered to half-staff the day following the terrorist attack during the Boston marathon, the shooting at the Washington Navy Yard and the following the death of Nelson Mandela. But it hasn't yet been lowered in honor of the service members murdered in Tennessee. By doing so Obama shows the highest degree of disrespect for the fallen soldiers. It turns out that for him the soldiers as well as veterans do not deserve any attention or respect. Soldiers are needed only when it is necessary to send them to the next unknown operation. They considered as meat. But in reality, they are our heroes! They were victims of a terrorist attack. They were victims of a man who at first won refugee status and then decided to kill in the name of Allah.

578,"'THAT'S NOT WHAT I AM': TRANSGENDER PERSON FIGHTS TO CHANGE 'F' TO 'M' ON DRIVER'S LICENSE. One of the friends of our group shared his story with us! He has been discriminated against by local authorities in Louisville, Ky.        There's a gap between Kentucky law and federal law. People trying to change the gender on a passport only need to be in transition, not post-surgery. But many transgender people never complete the surgery due to economical reasons, health issues etc. It seems that the law does not care about these people's circumstances. So typical of bureaucrats. It is very important for every transgender to be able to change his\her identification to reflect who they really are. It's not just about person dressed as a man one day and then dressed as a woman the next, or vice versa. It is about much more deep, more complex things. An authentic transgender man or woman only presents as the gender they truly are; And not the gender they were assigned to at birth. Transgender people are not trying to trick anyone by asking for identification changes. They are trying to avoid as much confusion as absolutely possible. Because it is confusing enough to be the gender different from the one you were assigned to at birth.

Lee framed his concern as one about the government discriminating against religious institutions â€”for discriminating against people in same-sex marriages. It's the latter he wants to allow by ensuring that the government never penalizes any religious institution that refuses to recognize a same-sex couple's marriage, or employ them, house them, or serve them.

550,"Controversy surrounding the flag only heats animosity among Americans. And it is becoming dangerous.        So, a family from Moseley, Virginia was threatened at gunpoint for waving the Confederate flag on their own private property on Monday night. While the family was expressing their First Amendment right by waving the flag in their own driveway next to a busy highway. A man driving an SUV pulled into the driveway, took out his gun, chambered a round, pointed it at the family. ""He slammed on the brakes and when he got right beside me, he pulled out a gun, chambered a round and told me my cause wasn't worth anything now,"" Mark Wilson said. When one spits upon the law because he thinks that it's amoral, it is beginning a chaos. Liberals want to ban a confederate flag because slavery was in the 18th and 19th centuries. They don't want to understand that slavery was legal in many countries of the world, but nobody wants to ban a flag of England or France. Activists and groups like the NAACP are also calling for statues and monuments to Confederate leaders to be demolished, including the carving at Stone Mountain, the largest bas relief sculpture in the world. Some are even demanding that Washington, DC be renamed in the name of political correctness because George Washington owned slaves. Liberals actually want to destroy American history and culture.

634,"Most parents aren't prepared for the words, ""Mom, Dad. I'm gay."" For many  parents first reaction probably will be ""How will I ever handle this?"" The  answer is simple and difficult at the same time: love and acceptance will help  to understand your child's sexuality and its meaning to you and your  continued relationship with your son or daughter.  Some parents feel they would have been happier not knowing about their  child's sexuality. They look back to before they knew and recall this time as  problem-free - overlooking the distance they often felt from their child during  that time.  Sometimes parents try to deny what is happening - by rejecting what they're  hearing (""It's just a phase; you'll get over it""); by shutting down (""If you  choose that lifestyle, I don't want to hear about it""); or by not registering the  impact of what we're being told (""That's nice, dear, and what do you want  for dinner?"").  Such denial often prove as a traumatizing experience for LGBT children. If  you as a parent 'II pretend to forgot the truth about your child's sexuality, you  would never really know your child. A large part of his or her life would be kept  secret from you, and you would never really know the whole person.  It is important to accept and understand your child's sexuality because  homosexuality and bisexuality are not a phase. While people may experiment  for some time with their sexuality, someone who has reached the point of  telling a parent that he or she is gay is not usually going through ""a phase"".  On the contrary, he or she has given long and hard thought to understanding  and acknowledging his or her sexual orientation. So if you're wondering, ""Is  she/he sure?"" the answer will almost always be ""yes""!

146,"Alabama Police Officer Kept His Job After Proposal to Murder Black Man and Hide Evidence A police officer in Alabama proposed murdering a black resident and creating bogus evidence to suggest the killing was in self-defense. Officer Troy Middlebrooks kept his job and continues to patrol Alexander City after authorities there paid the man $35,000 to avoid being publicly sued over the incident. Middlebrooks, a veteran of the US marines, said the man ""needs a god damn bullet"" and allegedly referred to him as ""that nigger"", after becoming frustrated that the man was not punished more harshly over a prior run-in. The payment was made to the black resident, Vincent Bias, after a secret recording of Middlebrooks's remarks was played to the city's police chiefs and the mayor. Elected city councillors said they were not consulted. Do you know that you can go to prison for murderous intent? However, if you are a white police officer, offering to KILL a BLACK AMERICAN and then hide the evidence, then you don't even get fired. Oh yeah, it's happening in a wonderful state called Alabama!

147,"Young, Unarmed Black Man Killed By Cop Didn't Want To'Die Too Young'        An unarmed black teenager in Texas was shot dead by a cop who had only recently graduated from the police academy. Just over a week before his death, he posted that he doesn't want to die too young on Twitter. Officers responded to a burglary call around 1 a.m. on Friday, hearing reports that a suspect was damaging vehicles. First spotting Taylor moving about the lot, officers also noticed Taylor's SUV had been smashed into the front of the dealership showroom. Finding that Taylor had moved inside the showroom, Arlington Police Chief Police Will Johnson said Taylor would not comply when told to lie down on the ground, but fled to a back room. 49-year-old officer Brad Miller entered the showroom to arrest Taylor, and then an altercation broke out. Miller fired four shots, including the fatal bullets from the gun of Miller. A second officer fired a taser, Johnson said. And now there are three main points that you should think of: 1) Taylor was described as a good kid. He was a football player at Angelo State University. Never was involved in criminal activities. 2) The officer graduated from the police academy less than 6 months ago and was working under the supervision of a training officer. 3) Taylor didn't want to die young.

442,"The threat of possible ISIS attacks on the U.S. Military families has risen        U.S. Senator Cory Gardner, a Republican from Colorado said in a statement that he was alarmed by the reports of an FBI alert that relatives of the US military personnel in Wyoming and Colorado were harassed outside their homes by Middle Eastern men and might have been under surveillance. A copy of the alert said that the wife of a U.S. military member was approached in front of her home in Colorado by two men. The incident took place in May. Similar incidents in Wyoming repeated in June. We see that the threat of possible ISIS attack on families of the U.S. military has risen. And when the threat is so real the US intelligence agencies are doing nothing. As a matter of the fact they don't fully perform their duties. First of all, the US security forces should take all appropriate measures to identify people who scour after the wives and children of the U.S. Military. Secondly, families of the U.S. Military should be taken under special protection of the police and the FBI. If even one hair of the U.S. Military family members will be lost then the work of American secret services isn't worth a dime as they cannot maintain security on the American soil. In case of a negative scenario there won't be any need in their work. And this will be the final nail in the coffin of the American secret services. Let's remember the last FBI and NSA failures, such as failure to stop the Boston Marathon Bombings and so on. Our soldiers fight for America at the other end of the world and they deserve that their families should be kept safe.",217,1867,Female,18 - 65+,08/07/15 04:50:56 AM PDT,08/09/15 04:50:55 AM PDT,https://www.facebook.com/patriototus,United States,,News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices,"People who like Being Patriotic,",,,Friends of people who are connected to Being Patriotic,,,,,,500,RUB,/2015-08/P(1)0002277.pdf,2015-q3.zip,2,,,,,

610,"On the first anniversary of Robin Williams' death, I want to remember his most influential LGBT roles throughout his acting career. The 63-year-old comedian, who had struggled with depression, died by suicide on August 11 2014. His widow Susan Schneider said at the time of his death: ""As he is remembered, it is our hope the focus will not be on Robin's death, but on the countless moments of joy and laughter he gave to millions."" Even at home, Williams exhibited acceptance for the LGBT community with his trademark playfulness. While he denied rumours about being gay, he had no qualms about discussing the sexuality of his pet pug. He said: ""I also have a gay rescue pug called Leonard. He has a boyfriend and they are planning to adopt a Siamese kitten together. We're very modern."" When the Westboro Baptist announced its intentions to picket his funeral, pro- LGBT organisation Planting Peace raised over $40,000 for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital â€”one of Williams' favourite charities. Robin Williams played many different roles in so many people's lives, and giving back to others was at the top of that list... We will never forget you.

431,"Barack Obama and his team have spent two months working to secure 41 percent for Iran deal. And now they claim enourmous victory.        Under the Constitution, treaties require the support of two-thirds of the Senate. The deal with Iran is a treaty in every respect â€” a legally binding long- term agreement between sovereign powers, in which hundreds of billions of dollars will flow and billions of dollars in nuclear materiel will be destroyed. Since this is a treaty and we have 100 senators, Obama should have been obliged to secure the backing of 67 senators, not 41. Obama knows he can never get Iran deal through the Congress. Americans voted for the GOP in 2014 to provide Republican majority in both the House of representatives and the Senate. It has to stop crazy ideas of Obama. But Obama is not stupid, he is very crafty politician. He succeded to change a subject to a vote â€” not of approval, like a treaty, but of disapproval. It would be treated like any piece of legislation. It would be voted on by the House and the Senate, and if they turned thumbs-down, he could then exercise his presidential veto. The Constitution requires a second vote by the two Houses of Congress to overturn such a veto â€” and in that case, the vote has to be by two-thirds. So, instead of 67 Senators having to support the deal to make it legal, 67 senators have to disapprove of it to render it null and void. It is enough 60 or more Senators to overturn a veto. But you remember, 41 Senators agree to support the deal. Thus, it may well be that for the first time in American history, a president will simply impose a treaty on the country without even the pretense of seeking and obtaining the advice and consent of the Congress. And how? With 42 percent. Barack Obama is very smart man, but he is not a patriot. He doesn't care about Americans.

I am against illegals not because am chauvinist, but because I am patriot!",5,29,Male,18 - 65+,09/01/15 11:58:28 PM PDT,09/02/15 11:58:28 PM PDT,https://www.facebook.com/patriototus,United States,,News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices,,Independence or Patriotism,,,,,,,,11.06,RUB,/2015-09/P(1)0002361.pdf,2015-q3.zip,2,,,,,
516,"The U.S. Constitutional Convention signed and adopted the Constitution at Philadelphia's Independence Hall 228 years ago. Since then the U.S. Constitution has been amended twenty-seven times. All of amendments are steps that made the United States the greatest country in the world.        The U.S. Constitution is not only the law, it is the basis of the country. Every true patriot respects it. Unfortunately, last decade has become the time of nihilism. More and more people don't respect American law. More and more people come to the United States and some of them don't feel reverence for our Constitution. It goes without saying that illegals who already broke the immigration law and will violate the supreme law easily. But the worst thing is that the current president of the United States and some high-ranking officials also spit upon the Constitution. They call for ban the right to bear arms, a confederate flag (I think this flag reflects not slavery, but important part of American history) and some liberals ban even the Old Glory -- a school district in Tennessee has banned all flags and banners, including the U.S. flag -- and so on. The same regards the Iran deal. America has a hard time. And we have to save the U.S. Constitution. We have to do it in God's name!

But the gang of anarchist thugs declared war against the police. I can't belive it's possible.        The police administer the law. Law-abidingness is an important part of American life. Of course, history knows police mistakes, but a mistaken arrest is very rare occurance. At the same time, don't forget that officers risk their lives every day. Americans have to honor sacrifices of policemen. Police officers significantly improve the quality of life for the citizens of their communities by keeping the peace despite sometimes overwhelming odds.

Some of us lost our family members or our friends, while others saw the terrorist attacks firsthand. R.I.P to all innocent victims, workers, police officers, firefighters and even dogs that died in this tragedy. This is a day in our history that everyone is going to remember. Today we should honor the memory of the killed ones and share our stories. What were you doing on 9/11? I'd like to tell you #My911 Story. I was only 15 when the attacks occurred. I was at school. I remember that somebody came and told us that there had been a serious bombing in NYC. We all said a prayer for the victims and went back to studies. But a few minutes later all students began receiving calls from their relatives. My mom called me crying. School was letting out early that day. When I came home I remember my dad watching the news and telling me that terrorists took responsibility for the attacks.

572,"Vatican Says Transgender Man Cannot Become A Godparent        The Vatican has rejected a request by a transgender man in Spain to become a godparent, ruling that his sexual identity means he is incapable of carrying out the task. Alex Salinas was asked by his family to be godfather to his nephew, but the bishop of his local diocese on Spain's southern coast questioned his gender identity. Salinas was born a woman but has since undergone hormone therapy and has a male ID in Spain. He is now waiting for gender surgery. Bishop Rafael Zornoza Boy of Cadiz and Ceuta rejected the family's request to name Salinas as a godfather. Then, after a media storm, the bishop wrote to the Vatican for advice. Zornoza published the Vatican's reasoning for rejecting Salinas' wish. It said transsexual behavior ""reveals in a public way an attitude opposite to the moral imperative of solving the problem of sexual identity according to the truth of one's own sexuality."" The pope supported gays, but now for some reason the transman wasn't allowed to be a godfather in Spain, an entirely Catholic, but at the same time, the most friendly country towards the LGBT community. Anyway it's just another superstition of Church.

Sinjir, an Imperial turncoat who now serves in Luke Skywalker's Rebellion, is the first major gay role to be part of the Star Wars universe. He reveals his sexuality to female bounty hunter Jas Emari, who tries to chat him up. Chuck Wendig, author of Star Wars: Aftermath, said: ""I don't think his sexuality needs to be this giant plot point. At the same time, it's part of who he is. Isn't that great, guys? Ain't no lie, It's a big step forward. We want to thank the creators of the new ""Star Wars"" for the incredible courage and opposition to conservative bias in Hollywood cinema.

459,"The leader of radical religious group Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan, announced that 20th anniversary Million Man March rally will take place on October 10, 2015 in Washington, D.C., at the National Mall. Organizers of the Million Man March call for justice, standing against the police and for blacks, Latinos and incarcerated. They say racism rises among the police officers, but in fact it rises among radical groups. Only black activists say ""black lives matter"", forgetting the fact that justice is when all lives matter. Americans are not against blacks, Latinos, etc. But if somebody breaks the law, he should be punished despite of his color or religion. If somebody goes over the speed limit, he should be ticketed. If somebody breaks the immigration law, he should be deported. If somebody kills a man, he should be imprisoned. Given the fact that two Islamic extremists who were arrested one year ago in Ferguson belong to the Nation of Islam, I cannot believe in Farrakhan's benevolent intentions. This Million Man March looks like another liberal overture to black and Muslim communities. This is a bad idea, especially if we take into account the recent news about British jihadi who have published the address of the Navy Seal Robert O'Neill, the man who fatally shot Osama bin Laden, and called on American extremists to execute him. There is no problem, if whoever wants to live in the United States. But he should live here legally; he should not break the law.

316,"Why I March! #JusticeOrElse        20 years ago. 20 years a million men, women and children gathered on the National Mall in Washington, DC answering the call from Minister Louis Farrakhan to come to the nation's capital and show our strength in numbers and unity and remind politicians that our voices would be heard. 20 years later, we return to call on our politicians to fix our broken criminal justice system once and for all. I march to fix a system that houses more black men in our prison system than there were black men enslaved in 1850. To fix a system that allows for local prosecutors to investigate their friends at the police department when there is an officer-involved shooting. To fix a system that has drug laws that disproportionately arrest black and brown people for using drugs when white people use at the same rate. To fix a system that has built a private industry off the backs of prisoners laboring for pennies. To fix a system that doesn't video record the actions of law enforcement at all times. To fix a system that criminalizes young women who are pimped and sexually trafficked before they even turn 18. To fix a system that does not collect any national data on incidents when police use excessive force or discharge their firearm. To fix a system that has incarcerated more people than any other nation in the world. To fix a system that has created a school to prison pipeline by harsher school discipline practices for young students of color. To fix a system of policing that targets communities of color by programs like ""Stop & Frisk"" or ""Broken Windows."" This is why I march. This is why we all should march in order to build a better future for our kids. We should fight the institutional racism in the country.

317,"Mass Shooting At Umpqua Community College In Oregon, 10 Reported Dead        Ten people were killed and seven were wounded Thursday in a shooting at a small community college in Roseburg, Oregon. The shooting took place in classrooms in Snyder Hall. Law enforcement officials have identified Chris Harper Mercer as the man responsible for the mass shooting.He had four weapons on him - three handguns and one assault weapon. Also he was definitely ready to put up a fight, because he had body armor and stash of ammunition. One of the witnesses said that the gunman first asked about people's religions before he began firing. The hospital said that all victims were female between the ages of 18 and 34, and quoted a doctor who said that an ""army"" of doctors and nurses had volunteered to help. It's the 45th shooting at a school so far this year. Obama said that America is the only country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months. And he's right. People already got used to this. Isn't it time for some gun control yet? Some white supremacists say that the killer was mixed and he supported BLM. This information is not confirmed and is more likely to be fake. This dude is definitely not black. His parents are Caucasian. The fact it's been a few hours since the shooting and they haven't say what race he is means he's white. And honestly, word ""shooting"" isn't used correctly here. Can we call it terror? Oh, wait.

14,"This military campaign is very ambiguous given that it has cost nearly 2,500 American lives and hundreds of billions of dollars. The goal was to ""disrupt the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations."" Well, the intervention deprived al-Qaida of a sanctuary. But al-Qaida â€” even after its leader Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. commandos â€” has spawned cells elsewhere and inspired other extremists in Syria and Iraq. And now ISIS is rising as the most powerful terrorist organisation in the world. So, the question is whether it's worth to risk the lives of thousands of American soldiers for the mission that hardly can be called successful? It seems that Obama should review his military strategy without delay.Join us!

They are very religious and probably linked with ISIS. California shooting should become a lesson for the administration â€” accepting refugees from Syria threatens the National security. It's tragedy. Enemies of America attacked our people again. Unfortunately, today we have no strong leader who is courageous enough to conquer terrorism.

905,There're a lot of racial discrimination going on in America these days. Can you imagine that a group of armed men took over a federal property and have vowed to kill if they are forced to leave there unless the government change the law in their favor. Nonsense! The ongoing Oregon standoff has taught us is that it's never been more apparent that the U.S. government values white lives above all others. The most stark example is comparing the kid-gloves treatment the white gunmen in Oregon are getting with the 1985 bombing of the MOVE house in Philadelphia. #GunmeninOregon #TheMove #1985Bombing,554,7452,Female,18 - 54,01/21/16 03:53:21 AM PST,01/23/16 03:53:21 AM PST,https://www.facebook.com/WiIIiamsandKalvin/,United States,,News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices,,"BlackNews.com, HuffPost",,,,,,,,1000,RUB,/2016-01/P(1)0001581.pdf,2016-q1.zip,2,,,,,

1327,"Congressional Republicans voted on Thursday to make it more difficult for refugees from Syria and Iraq to come to the US as the fallout from last Friday's Isis terrorist attacks in Paris continues.   In addition, more than half of the US's governors have said they will no longer provide placement for Syrian refugees, arguing that they pose too great a risk to national security. New Jersey governor and Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie has said his state will not take in any refugees â€” ""not even orphans under the age of five"". Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal has said he has directed state police to ""track"" the Syrian refugees in his state, something his state police have played down. GOP presidential hopefuls Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush have suggested the US government prioritize Christian refugees. Barack Obama has pledged to veto the legislation, and has condemned the anti-refugee comments as ""un-American"", but experts worry the backlash could have dangerous consequences if these claims go unchecked.

Yet they always forget to underpin their empty words with facts. Not like all  these SJWs, let's refer to racial discrimination in the army of Union. A black  soldier was paid $10 a month with a $3 clothing fee taken out, while a white  soldier was paid $13 a month but was not forced to pay a clothing allowance.  Almost a twofold difference!

But after just one season pitching for a Cardinals minor league team and performing solidly, Dunnington quit. He explains that during his playing days, he was a closeted gay man playing in an uncomfortable environment. A particular low point came when a coach made a bragging reference to the brutal murder in Wyoming of gay college student Matthew Shepard whose death led to federal hate crime legislation in the US.

841,"A young black guy who was mentally disabled decided to end his life, but will only do that by making the cops kill him. This is absolutely insane in the highest order. He took a gun and ordered his other two brothers to take a video of the whole incident. Michael Ford, at the police vicinity opened fire and got the cop's attention. The filming was still in process as he commanded. The first cops who appeared fired back and almost immediately ended up drawing fire. He gave the other officer a chance to get into position when he opened fire. It's quite not understandable why his own cop shot him and shot the mentality ill man too. This is a good example of sick reality too. Is there any explanation why cops have started shooting each other?

Alabama happens to be one of the nation's poorest states which have led to overcrowd in its prison. The prison system houses 24,000 inmates but it was designed for 13,000.Let me enlighten you a little on how it's going to be done. Four other larger prisons will be built additionally to prevent the rate of overcrowd. Even though one would have taught of using this money for projects like health care facilities and other, he chose prisons. It's not bad though, at least inmates will have free live behind bars.

782,"Brendan Carter decided to pay a visit to his sick uncle and was held by officers in a public RTS bus station in Rochester, New York. Carter said he was at a station waiting for bus. Freeing himself from emotional trauma, Carter decided to hip his soul with music, when he put his headphones on and started to dance. Suddenly, officers approached him and began asking him out of the premises. Apparently he had not committed any crime or violated any order, so he was disturbed and begun to argue with them. Seriously this guy was detained for useless reasons. This is what American police find interest in â€” unnecessary and useless way of harassing blacks. Very ridiculous.

Matthew works at an orphanage built and run by an American citizen named Upendo Children Centre. The main aim of this orphanage was to assist abandoned children in Nairobi, Kenya. Upon Matthew's arrival in Kenya, he insisted on not staying in the apartment allocated to him by authorities but preferred to stay in the very dormitory where these children stayed. He also based his choice on being in a better position to assist the children should the need arise. Mathew raped three teenagers â€” ages of 5, 9, and 15 respectively for not less than 8 times. He also maltreated a 12 year old boy.

826,"It is so disheartening knowing that people are put behind bars because they failed to settle a fine. Most people are jailed because one way or the other there was no money to do what was necessary at a particular time even though they were innocent. Prosecutors have developed this platform as a gold mine, extracting huge sum of money from civilians. You can be put behind bars if you fail to comply with the demands. Suddenly one's life becomes tattered when jail comes in, because there is no freedom of making a better living. Federal prosecutors should shake up and hold judges and all these people who take advantages of people by making them pay huge sums of money or put someone behind bars because he/she couldn't pay a fine.

537,"The liberal mass media tried to overblow a story about the KKK's endorsement of Trump. They claimed Donald is supported by David Duke and ""white supremacists"". The journalists are trying to depict Trump as a racist and continue their attempts even after Trump officially declared ""I don't know anything about David Duke... You're asking me a question that I'm supposed to be talking people I know nothing about.""        However, ""for some reasons"" the same mass media in their revelation campaign forgot to mention Hillary Clinton's ties to Robert Byrd, a former KKK leader. Hillary described him as a man of ""surpassing eloquence and nobility"". In 2010 after Byrd died she released a tribute video saying ""It is almost impossible to imagine the United States Senate without Robert Byrd. He was not just its longest-serving member; he was its heart, its soul, and its historian. From my first day in the Senate, I sought out his guidance, and he was always generous with his time and his wisdom. I admired his tireless advocacy for his West Virginia constituents, his fierce defense of the Constitution, and the traditions of the Senate, and his passion for a government that improves the lives of the people it serves."" So here the mass media give us an political paradox: a Republican candidate can't be endorsed by a former KKK member, but a Democrat can easily show her respect and honor to a former racist leader without being judged for that.

Oh wonderful, so she admits she wants to be the second Obama, like the first one isn't enough. And we know what's behind this world ""children"" â€” young men who claim to be less than 18.

1610,"Religious leaders joined local organizations in rallying support for two men who said they were attacked outside a convenience store this weekend in what police are investigating as a possible hate crime. Authorities are reviewing surveillance video of the reported attack, which occurred shortly after 3 a.m. Saturday at the Kwik Shop at 4820 E. 21 st St. That's just northeast of the Wichita State University campus. One of the victims was Khondonkor Usama, Muslim 23, the second victim, is a 19-year-old student who has chosen to remain anonymous. They were getting gas and snacks at about 3 a.m. Saturday when they noticed a man shouting at someone who had apparently asked him for gas money. When the suspect began using racial slurs against the man who asked him for money, one of the students attempted to intervene. The attacker then turned his wrath on the two students, stopping his motorcycle in front of Usama's car and approaching Usama's friend, who had gotten out of the car. The suspect called his friend ""brown trash"" and told him he had to ""leave this country,"" According to Usama's account, his friend responded: ""This is my country. Who the hell are you to tell me to leave?"" The incident ""escalated really quick,"" with the suspect attempting to punch his friend, Usama said. When he attempted to break up the fight, Usama said he was assaulted and knocked down. He called 911, and as he was on the phone the attacker rode circles around the two students, chanting ""Trump! Trump! Trump!"" and screaming, ""We'll make America great again!

We didn't forget who supported the war in Iraq, we are Muslims and Americans, so we know your support to invade Iraq in 2003 have caused hundreds of American soldiers to die hundreds of miles away from their homes, and also millions of Iraqi Muslims, including innocent men, women and children, to die in their homes, and for what? Libya! You supported bombing and destroying the whole country just to kill AI- Gaddafi. You said in an interview: ""We came, we saw, he died"". Let's not forget about Benghazi, where you declined to increase the embassy security, and that caused the death of the U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith and CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty and Ten others were also injured in the attacks. You killed Saddam Hussein and AI-Gaddafi in Iraq and Lybia leaving the countries there in chaos, which led to the birth of ISIS, which is now a threat not only to the U.S. but the whole world! You are supporting gun control, disarming the American citizens and at the same time selling weapons to groups in the Middle East to fight their leaders, creating on the short run terrorist groups as we saw in Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. 8 years ago you were against refugees, but now you support them. 10 years ago you were against same sex marriage, but now you support it.

Some of them have spent more than half a year awaiting a trial, but the city failed to provide the legal help to them. Each year the budget is shredding, but the Louisiana remains the state with the highest incarceration rate.        Each year the system incarcerates thousands of black men and women for minor violations, but they let go the murderers and rapists.

1237,"ANOTHER BLACK MAN MURDERED IN POLICE CUSTODY. THINGS HAVE BEEN VERY SILENT ON HIS BEHALF The 31-year-old black man died Feb. 20 at Fairfield Medical center after he had a Â°medical episode' at the jail when deputies were moving Ariel J. Clark from one cell to another. According to police reports; Ariel J. Clark, 31 was too combative with officers and was threatening to kill them during his arrest. On February 17, a motorist called 911 after interacting with Clark; reporting that Clark, who was driving his wife and two children from Buffulo to Texas, was threatening to kill him and his son. Clark's wife said that a man and his son began to argue with her husband, who had been acting wierd because he hadn't slept in five days. When the police arrived. Clark was arrested, taken to the Fairfield County Jail where he was placed in a restraint chair for his combative behavior. Three days after arriving in jail, Clark had some breathing difficulties and deputies started chest compression. But an hour later he was pronounced dead at a local hospital. An investigation has been opened after the death of a Fairfield County Jail inmate. Now the question is whether the jail's standard operating procedures were followed. We would like to see a true picture of what he looked like after ""fighting"" with the police. Also, we would like to see the picture of him when he arrived at hospital. For now the only thing we know is that another black man died in police custody.",6,54,All,18 - 65+,04/07/16 07:44:35 AM PDT,04/08/16 07:44:34 AM PDT,https://www.facebook.com/Blacktivist-128371547505950/,Living In: United States,,News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices,"People who like Blacktivist,",,,Friends of people who are connected to Blacktivist,,,,,,51.87,RUB,/2016-04/P(1)0000398.pdf,2016-q2.zip,2,,,,,

307,"A rally in loving memory of Aiyana Jones May 16 marked the sixth anniversary of the brutal slaying of 7-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones by Detroit Police Officer Joe Weekley. She was shot by the cop while she slept on a couch during a botched raid. The killer is still employed by the Detroit Police Department. He was charged with involuntary manslaughter and two lesser charges in her death, but the case was dropped in January 2015. Justice hasn't been served for Aiyana and her grieving family. We're planning a peaceful rally in front of the Coleman A. Young Municipal Center on May 21 to honor the memory of Aiyana and other victims of police violence and demand demilitarization of police. We should draw as much attention as possible to the lack of justice for the families of those who lost their beloved ones at the hands of the police. Invite everyone you know and join us on May 21.

Roby Rose thinks that it's not possible to change someone's sexuality because it's something you're born with and it's not changeable. I agree with her! Unfortunately, bigots like to say that homosexuality is a choice, so it can be ""cured"". Just like Ben Carson thinks that you're choosing to be gay and the prison is the proof of that.

1428,"A new disturbing dashcam video from May 2013 is shining light on what happened the night a Chicago. The video shows how officers, Michelle Morsi-Murphy and Jose Lopez, brutalized Rev. Catherine Brown. Brown was driving back home; when Morsi- Murphy jumped out of the car and approached her yelling curse words and demanding she move the vehicle back. When Brown reached for her license; Lopez pointed a gun at her head. Moreover, Lopez WAS LAUGHTING at poor Brown; who was beat and pepper-sprayed by police. Brown is not the only victim, her kids had suffered from pepper spray too. The US police is just insane. What's the problem with peaceful arrest? Why the hell they treat us as animals?

Jail officers said Bethea had threatened them and that's why he was hit with a stun gun but I guess cops didn't know the camera was recording them. FIVE OFFICERS stood over Bethea and just watching how Clark pulled the trigger two more times. As usual, no charges were ever filed against the officers involved in Bethea's death. There is no doubt that Bethea was murdered. Have you noticed that it took 20 minutes passed by before another officer summoned a nurse and they attempted to revive Bethea.

1492,"SHOCKING!!! Cops can't stop using their blue privilege for illegal parking. Could you imagine how off-duty deputy Tracy Weiss was shocked when she realized that her budge won't protect her from paying parking fines? Her face is priceless.        The story happened last month when Weiss found her car being towed for illegal parking. The cop jumped into another vehicle to block the driver, who had towed her car. When she exited the vehicle she had her gun drawn. The driver started recording the incident when he understood that his life is under threat. That's how $62.50 fine turned into $125. The sheriff's office said Weiss has been an Orange County deputy for 11 years and they are investigating the incident. I have only one question: is that how PD trains police in our country? For 11 years she should know how to fix the situation like that. The only reason she should identify herself as an officer is to explain why she has a holstered weapon. Aside from that she should not have mentioned it nor should she have drawn the weapon. To my mind, this woman need to stop being a deputy and carrying a gun. Such cops and people as well should stay away from guns. This would give our citizens a chance to get back home alive.

Back in 2015, Douglas Babbitt was talking on the phone in the driver's seat of his parked van when a police officer asked if an open beer bottle on the ground near the vehicle's front passenger door belonged to him. Notice the location of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on the passenger's side. When Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the situation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man briefly lying unconscious on the ground. The beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows that he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys?

852,"All people have to understand that the police service is exactly like a secret gay club, the reason being that no one knows what goes on inside there even if it's evident. There's a kind of code of silence, even if you saw something or just know something about other police officer, you keep silence about it. But if you are in a member of a club, you can be sure that no one will ever let your secrets out. Statistically, 46% of cops admit to witnessing misconduct by other cops! Also, 73 % of the individuals pressuring officers to keep quiet about the misconduct are leaders. 8% of the officers who admitted to intentionally withholding the information about officer misconduct were upper administrators. Cops will always lie to suit interaction or conversation. Sadly enough, ""Sworn officer of the court"" is most likely to lie than the citizen he is even accusing. So, the lie is a norm for the officers who are keeping the code of silence, and it's a miracle if a police officer tells the truth.

As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do literally nothing without using their guns. Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with chemical and electrical ways, rape or even kill you ""doing their job."" All those things and more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America. Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is why cops are so violent now.

1501,"Cops are allergic to cameras, they don't like being recorded because it won't allow them to break the law and lie about the circumstances which presented them the opportunity to break the law.        ?WARNING!!!? In yet another disturbing video of police escalating violence in a public school, a Philadelphia school cop was caught on video in an intense altercation with a student. According to the Philadelphia Student Union, of which the alleged victim, Brian Burney, the incident was all over a dispute over using the bathroom. The student, who recorded the incident, was told to delete it. All that is left is a brief clip showing the officer, who is twice the size of Burney, on top of him. I don't understand why are there cops in schools? Cops are nothing more then a bunch of bullies or gang members in police uniforms! Whatever happened to deans? Moreover, don't you think it's a bit strange, when an officer forces someone to delete video? Obviously, police is trying to hide something and their testimony should be considered a lie. Also, is not destruction of evidence a crime? What do you think about it guys?

1507,"Clark Dickson. a veteran Seattle police department officer, punched a homeless 21-year-old man in the head and remained unpunished. The cop said that his misconduct was ""justified"" because the man had spit at him. Almost one year after the incident. the footage showing the punch was released. Personally. I didn't notice in the video the suspect spitting at Dickson. However; the police department didn't consider it necessary to punish the cop.

In popular culture, he will be remembered as the man who was not afraid when it came to speaking his mind -- someone who was not shy of talking about things unrelated to boxing, and would always take the right stand when needed. He risked his career and reputation by opposing the US-Vietnam War. Furthermore, he refused to serve in the US Army and in the process, was accused of committing a felony.

Over the course of the investigation, authorities seized six pounds of crystal meth, eight pounds of marijuana, 49.3 grams of heroin, four handguns and $2.5 million in cash, according to a press release. ""It would be safe to say that the money would be taken back to Mexico, and that's where the source of the cocaine was,"" special agent Tim Stone said. This is good news, but sadly this operation is just one of the thousands, which makes it just a slap on the wrist. Our traitor government does nothing to prevent drug influx, but only trying to create the presence of an effort. The most part of this poison comes through southern border, but it is still as unprotected as it possibly can be and drug cartels are abusing it as much as they can. At the expense of our tax dollars and lives of our youth, our government officials continue to make some kinds of vile deals with drug cartels to get filthy rich and gain more control over weaken nation.

There's no proof that he was into the movement anyhow. It happened almost a week ago and the police can't show anything to prove there was a link between Micah X. Johnson and Black Lives matter.

1480,"Everyday we watch, read and receive news of police beating, assaulting, and killing innocent people. These videos and instances have become so common that people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were wondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now, karma's coming back for blue pigs!        A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two officers for seemingly no reason. The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do literally nothing without using their guns. Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with chemical and electrical ways, rape or even kill you ""doing their job."" All those things and more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America. Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is why cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our ancestors did it for centuries. Take out a few dozen cops and the rest will change.

Another arrest was carried out the following day, during the morning hours where 23 protestors were arrested and charged with public nuisance and unlawful assembly. Since July 7, the day after which Castile was fatally shot to death, sympathizers have been embarking on demonstration outside the governor's home but police officers are asking the protesters out of the premises because they are blocking the streets. This request seemed not successful, therefore the protesters stood against the officers. According to the governor, the protestors are welcomed to stay because he had no problem with them being there. Even though the street was cleared few days after July 18, some protesters have returned to the premises to continue the demonstration.

This is a real proof that white officers will just kill blacks and still walk without prosecution. This is the reason why they are not scared of taking a black person's life. Fortunately he has lost an appeal to get his job back â€” for the second time, but what I find really interesting is the reason why he was fired. It is now absolutely clear that Police Chief fired Manney for his actions that led to the shooting, but not for the shooting itself.

We had a moment to present economic or social advancement plans to president Obama, yet we refused and let anti- blacks trick us into thinking that was not elected to benefit just black people alone. President Obama was elected for a reason. He was the stepping stone for blacks to rise but it was blown away. Now, it is the time of White America to rebuild and advance and make their race great. The war for power between blacks and whites is very real, but the black community has forgotten. Consequently, the power of black is fading day by day because those in position are descending from the ladder every day. In no time; ""White Power' will be stronger than before.

More refugees, mosques, and terrorist  attacks. Banned guns. Continuing economic depression. Let's remind them  what Texas is made of and show that we're ready to SECEDE!

In other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they need so bad! Hardly will she change her mind on the issue if she is elected.

433,"Boston police shot and killed a man wearing body armor and wielding an assault rifle who critically injured two officers responding to a domestic disturbance call late Wednesday, according to Police Commissioner William Evans. A gun battle raged at an East Boston home as a suspect, Kirk Figueroa, 33, of East Boston, critically injured two Boston police officers late on October 12. He was then shot and killed by other officers who ran into the home to drag out their wounded colleagues while undergoing heavy gunfire themselves. This bloody massacre is a vivid example of the fact that the war with police is too far from being OVER. It's only coming and the consequences will be destructive if Hillary Clinton, the main hardliner against cops, will become the President of the United States. Defending the police against liberal and racist accusations is a solemn duty of every American Patriot. Recent spate of cop killings indicates that American national identity is undermined and replaced by ridiculous social experiments liberal elites are constantly setting up on the country. Democrats are unable to secure the police from attacks of extremist movements like Black Lives Matter. The Nation must unite against reverse racism, against those who want to destroy America!

1107,"On October 15, 1966, Bobby Seale and Huey P. Newton have founded BPP. Their idea was simple - we can't just talk to make the change, we must take action. They started to monitor the behavior of police officers and challenge police brutality in Oakland, California. And they succeeded. Unfortunately, the government and especially Federal Bureau of Investigation called the party ""the greatest threat to the internal security of the country"". They tried to close it, to incarcerate BPP's participants, and in 1982 the original party was dissolved. 50 years have passed since BBP's foundation, but the situation in the country stills the same. Cops are shooting Blacks. It spreads through all the country like the disease. Nowadays we need Black Panthers as never before. We need a strong hand that can protect us, that can keep our people safe, that can make Black Lives really matter. Let's get together and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the party that has made the change. Let's honor its founders and participants. Let's share their ideas and ideals!

2789,"HILLARY CLINTON CHEATS AMERICAN VETERANS The last time Hillary Clinton had a press conference on veterans' issues was in 2015 and since then all her plans and offers concerning veterans' life improvement were stated only in emails made by her staff. And here are some real Clinton decisions: â€”Last year, Clinton claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had been exaggerated by Republicans. â€”In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007 supplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans' medical care. -In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20 million for veterans' health care facilities. -In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for 113 billion for veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits."" In other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they need so bad! Hardly will she change her mind on the issue if she is elected. Clinton poses a direct threat to the American veterans' society, but still practically no one raises these concerns. Think twice before voting for her!",0,0,Female,18 - 65+,10/12/16 05:55:09 AM PDT,10/13/16 05:55:07 AM PDT,https://www.facebook.comNeterans-Come-First-1757336424535312/,Living In: Turkmenistan,,News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices,,,,,,,,,,,,/2016-10/P(1)0006536.pdf,2016-q4.zip,2,,,,,

1051,"CHARLESTON COP WHO FATALLY SHOT BLACK MAN ASKS JUDGE TO DROP CHARGES, CITING DOUBLE RISK North Charleston police officer Michael Slager, who shot and killed 50-year- old Scott after an April 2015 traffic stop, and his attorneys urged the court to drop murder charge due to the double jeopardy that Slager faced before the shooting. According to ex-cop's attorneys, their defendant acted in self- defense despite the fact that Scott was unarmed and Slager fired eight times, hitting Scott five times from behind. Slager's defense attorney's: ""The double-teaming of Slager ... is a chilling example of how far politically motivated politicians and prosecutors will go to seek headlines and feather their own nests at the expense of a public servant ... who had to make a split- second life or death decision that will be second-guessed by comfortable armchair quarterbacks. This is unconscionable.' The shooting occurred in April 2015 when Slager stopped Scott for a broken brake light on the Mercedes-Benz he was driving. According to Slager's dashcam, ex-cop asked Scott to show his driving license and questioned him about documents for the car. When Slager returned to his car, Walter Scott jumped out of the car and ran away giving Slager chase. According to a bystander's video, Scott ran away from the officer when Slager opened fire. We've seen what happened in different parts of America: unarmed dead black bodies lying across the streets at the hands of police officers and none of them found guilty. That's why today it's important to send a message to other police officers that if they do this, it's harsh penalty to pay.",6656,36295,All,16 - 65+,11/03/16 08:11:51 AM PDT,11/10/16 07:11:51 AM PST,https://www.facebook.com/Blacktivist-128371547505950/,United States,,News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices,,"Pan-Africanism, African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954-68), African-American history or Black (Color)",English (UK) or English (US),,,,,,,500,RUB,/2016-11/P(1)0002859.pdf,2016-q4.zip,2,,,,,

Police arrived at the scene after a series of 911 calls in which they were warned of a reckless driver and her erratic behavior. When cop saw Shirley, who was off her bipolar medication, they boxed her in with their patrol cars. When she started approaching them, law enforcement officers opened fire at her. The incident resulted in a fatal shooting. After the shooting, Shirley was taken to County Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and was pronounced dead. Michelle Shirley, 39, who received a diagnosis of a mental disorder tried to balance motherhood and law school. In a video titled, ""It's Up to Us,"" she was asking people to take seriously a mental disorder and seek help because ignoring it can take away years of people's lives.

3157,"Joshua was born in Chicago, Illinois, and raised in Indianapolis. Two months before his death, he proposed to his longtime girlfriend and the mother of two sons. Joshua Beal had come to Chicago to serve as a pallbearer in the funeral of his cousin Marcus Washington who was fatally shot on October 27, 2016 in Indianapolis at the age of 26. Beal was fatally shot after he and several relatives were involved in what authorities called a road rage incident with an off-duty police officer and an off- duty firefighter. The relatives along with others in the caravan were headed to Southwest Memorial Chapel after burying their cousin Marcus Washington, she said. Suddenly, Boxley said, a car cut her off and then tried to run her 17-year-old sister off the road. She said her family as well as the motorist who had cut her off â€” who she believed was a Chicago police officer â€” stopped and got out of their cars. At some point the man pushed her female cousin to the ground and pulled a gun on her, pointing it at her face, according to Boxley. She said the man got inside his car but exited again and ""he just started shooting,"" hitting the windshield of a car containing Beal, who had pulled his gun when he saw the man holding a gun on their cousin. Boxley said Beal legally owned the gun and did not fire it. Boxley said the man pulled Beal out of his front passenger seat and began shooting him. ""I was hoping my brother wasn't dead,"" said Boxley. Beal's mother said he was a father to two children, a 4-year-old and a 2-year- old, and that his fiancee was a stay-at-home mother. ""This is what CPD do. They tear our families apart over and over again. They have no consideration for life,"" - Tiffaney Boxley.

1089,"COLIN KAEPERNICK DONATED TO BLACK YOUTH PROJECT 100 Of course, many of you will scoff at comparing 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick to Martin Luther King Jr., who also demanded better from America in 1966. But after all, Kaepernick is a great athlete who not just sat out the national anthem in protest, but also gave back to the community by donating to the Black Youth Project 100. Kaepernick donated to the Chicago chapter of the organization toward ""Chapter-specific ideas and endeavors centered on advancing nda to Build Black Futures"" which is dedicated to creating justice and freedom for all Black people in order to improve the lives of black people in the United States of America.

3280,"Before he became a lawyer and prolific supporter of prisoner rights, Daniel Manville spent three years and four months in the slammer for manslaughter. Manville continued to study while incarcerated and eventually earned two college degrees during his sentence. He became enamored with the legal profession and went to law school right after his parole. He finally passed the bar exams in Michigan and Washington, DC after waiting many years to be approved by the respective boards. Afterwards, Manville worked tirelessly to improve the prison system and represented various inmates and prison guards in civil cases. Nowadays, Manville teaches law at Michigan State University, where he hopes the insights he shares with students inspire them to someday help improve the system as well.  â€”ListVerse-r",20,314,All,18 - 65+,12/29/16 03:04:19 AM PST,12/30/16 03:04:19 AM PST,https://www.facebook.com/Hell_and_Back-1806743482876111/,Living In: United States,,News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices,,Innocence Project or Prison reform,,,,,,,,200,RUB,/2016-12/P(1)0005887.pdf,2016-q4.zip,2,,,,,

3284,"Prior to cooking delicious five-star cuisine, celebrity chef Jeff Henderson cooked something else entirely dangerousâ€”cocaine. As a teenager, Henderson manufactured and sold drugs in his native home in Los Angeles. By 19, he was already earning US $35,000 per week. Henderson was later apprehended and imprisoned for 10 years after one of his men was caught carrying a big shipment. It was in prison that he discovered his natural flair for cooking, while he was on kitchen duty. He was released early for good behavior and soon started working for some of LA's top restaurants before venturing into Las Vegas. After experiencing many rejections due to his felonious past, Henderson finally managed to land a job at Caesar's Palace. It was only a matter of time before he finally started getting recognition and awards, including best Las Vegas Chef in 2001. All the fame and success hasn't gotten to Henderson's head though and he has continued to share his experiences with at-risk youth to show what they can achieve in life with the right choices.",84,463,Male,18 - 65+,12/29/16 03:03:27 AM PST,12/30/16 03:03:27 AM PST,https://www.facebook.com/Hell_and_Back-1806743482876111/,Living In: United States,,News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices,,Innocence Project or Prison reform,,,,,,,,200,RUB,/2016-12/P(1)0005895.pdf,2016-q4.zip,2,,,,,

2832,"Shocking video was captured by the police officer body cam. On September 4, 2013, a student from the University of Central Florida Victoria King was pulled over by officer Timothy Isaacs for a bad tail light. The situation escalated quickly when the police officer demanded King to roll down her window ""all the way"" to receive her ticket. When King refused, which by the way was a perfectly legal thing to do, the police officer broke out the car window and arrested her in a brutal way. Instead of simply citing her, the police officer demanded the woman to obey and threw her to the ground. When you're Black no violation is small enough. Every contact with the police ends brutally for Black people and nothing seems to change.

766,"I believe Ron Paul's position on our foreign military policy is absolutely right. After all, it was Trump who promised to put America First and promised to end Obama's policy of wasting budget money on military operations overseas. ""We're not going into Syria"", Trump said it to calm down those who got really concerned about a possibility of America getting involved into another war. really want to trust these words, but unfortunately many high-ranked politicians want to force Trump to pull America into another war. Here's what Ron Paul thinks about it: ""By the end of this month, Defense Secretary James Mattis and National Security Advisor HR McMaster will deliver to President Trump their plans for military escalations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. President Trump would be wise to rip the plans up and send his national security team back to the drawing board â€” or replace them. There is no way another ""surge"" in Afghanistan and Iraq (plus a new one in Syria) puts America first. There is no way doing the same thing over again will succeed any better than it did the last time."" Syria will be just another oil war; Iraq cost our country 4,500 soldier lives, and why the hell are we still in Afghanistan? We've started the whole Afghanistan thing to beat the Soviets, and no there's no Soviet Union on the world map, and all the communists left on this planet are only Chinese and Californian students.",189,2409,Male,18 - 65+,05/16/17 07:32:20 AM PDT,05/17/17 07:32:20 AM PDT,https://www.facebook.com/patriototus/,Living In: United States,,News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices,,,,,,,,,,400,RUB,/2017-05/P(1)0002777.pdf,2017-05.zip,2,,,,,
767,"The Obama Administration turned a great idea of fighting terrorism into drawing our country into another regime change venture. Our military presence in Syria now doesn't serve American interests. Our soldiers are there to fight and die for Globalists, Saudis and Israelis, but not for Americans. And that's why we keep on talking about it: this policy is directly opposite to the ""America First"" concept. I believe Trump can fix it, just like he promised. Sadly days after days and weeks after weeks of Trump's presidency there are no changes in that direction. Israel captured a Syrian region named Golan Heights in 1967, and today this land is internationally considered to be occupied territory. Israelis want to use Trump's influence so the world would acknowledge Israeli sovereignty. Trump is a dealer, and maybe he's trying make a deal out of it, but there's one important thing here: under no circumstances can our soldiers' lives be put at risk for that. So many times during the presidential campaign Trump said ""let's bring back our soldiers home"", and now it's really time to do it.

769,"Our politicians should never forget that. We've been watching our military commandership wasting lives of American soldiers for too long, let's hope it will end now when Trump is in charge. A new Marine Corps artillery unit was sent to assist Syrian opposition in Raqqa, according to Army Maj. Josh T. Jacques, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command. The artillery unit recently replaced about 400 Marines from the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which provided artillery support to Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces expected to launch an offensive against Raqqa. We must deal with ISIS and end the terrorist threat once and for all. Unfortunately that's hardly possible because of the corruption in the Government. The Swamp in DC is still not drained from people like Senator McCain, and that's why our troops not only focus on defeating terrorism, but also getting involved into another regime change venture and possibly another oil war. We're fighting radical Islamists, but we're also siding with Syrian opposition, the very same radical Islamists, and there's absolutely no guarantee that these rebels won't replace ISIS when it's gone.

1478,"Everyday we watch, read and receive news of police beating, assaulting, and killing innocent people. These videos and instances have become so common that people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were wondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now, karma's coming back for blue pigs!        A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two officers for seemingly no reason. The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do literally nothing without using their guns. Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with chemical and electrical ways, rape or even kill you ""doing their job."" All those things and more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America. Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is why cops are so violent now.

1500,"Cops are allergic to cameras, they don't like being recorded because it won't allow them to break the law and lie about the circumstances which presented them the opportunity to break the law.        ?WARNING!!!? In yet another disturbing video of police escalating violence in a public school, a Philadelphia school cop was caught on video in an intense altercation with a student. According to the Philadelphia Student Union, of which the alleged victim, Brian Burney, the incident was all over a dispute over using the bathroom. The student, who recorded the incident, was told to delete it. All that is left is a brief clip showing the officer, who is twice the size of Burney, on top of him. I don't understand why are there cops in schools? Cops are nothing more then a bunch of bullies or gang members in police uniforms! Whatever happened to deans? Moreover, don't you think it's a bit strange, when an officer forces someone to delete video? Obviously, police is trying to hide something and their testimony should be considered a lie.

It seems like republicans are using every single possibility to get more money for their wars, and they don't mind it if average Americans live in poverty or without affordable medicine. Why additional billions to Military? Our Department of Defense budget is already bigger than military budgets of the next eight countries combined, isn't it enough? Here is what Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: ""Based on what we know about this budget, the good news -- the only good news -- is that it's likely to be roundly rejected by members of both parties here in the Senate â€” just as the last budget was""",267,1778,All,18 - 65+,05/23/17 07:36:32 AM PDT,05/25/17 07:36:32 AM PDT,https://www.facebook.com/bornliberal/,United States,,News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices,"People who like Born Liberal,",,,Friends of people who are connected to Born Liberal,,,,,,267,RUB,/2017-05/P(1)0004831.pdf,2017-05.zip,2,,,,,
2426,"The administration is requesting a $54 billion increase in military spending for 2018. Not a small sum, it's roughly equal to the entire annual military budget of France, larger than the defense budgets of the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan, and only $12 billion less than the entire Russian military budget of 2015. But what about domestic and State Department spending? For example, such an increase for the Department of Defense means 31 % cut in the EPA's budget and a 29% cut in the State Department. In other words, it's a great number of opportunities squandered in favor of the interests of high- powerful warmongers in our government. Environment, diplomacy, alternative energy, housing or infrastructure repair? Not today. Today they want thousands of peaceful people to die for their money interests. And they use every opportunity to start another war, they are acting the same way in Syria.

There's always was a risk for them to be arrested and subjected to a great violence, and be followed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need of swords to defend them: the phrase is expressive of the danger they would be exposed to, and of their need of protection.

After the critics complained about the Army's unfair burden on black women's hair, the U.S. Army again lifted the ban on dreadlocks that was instated in April 2014. The ban faced an instant backlash from black women so the Army unbanned braids and twists amidst the criticism. Some of the female soldiers used harsh chemicals to keep their hair straight. Moreover, every eight weeks it cost them to $80. Thus, the ban on dreadlocks caused a lot of unnecessary stress. The ban on locs, which was part of Army Regulation 670-1, remained until January 2017. The new rules offered female soldiers another hairstyle option. Now the rules allow dreadlocks and locks but only if they are less than a half- inch wide.

2476,"Drum and Spear Bookstore in Washington DC was opened by veteran members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in summer of 1968. The shop was selling the books of black writers. The next year the owners of Drum and Spear launched its own publishing company. One of co-founders said ""We don't define profit in terms of money. The profit is the patronage of the community, which allows the store to self-support."" Drum and Spear was aimed to show people the true black culture and history, something beyond the American school program. It's reflected in the name of the shop: the drum is for ""communications within the diaspora,"" and the spear symbolizes ""whatever else might be necessary for the liberation of the people."" The best-sellers of early 70s in this shop were such books as the Autobiography of Malcolm X and Eldridge Cleaver's Soul on Ice. This bookstore inspired people around the country to open similar bookstores. Drum and Spear and many other stores were not only the shops, but a ""free spaces"" for thinking black people where folks could meet and discuss the vital issues. Let's not forget our legacy! We need this drum and we need this spear today, in 2017.        #blackexcellence #blackperfection #blackbeauty #blackbusiness #africanamerican #blackcommunity #melanin #blackpride #blackout #america #usa #blackscience #education #diversity #drumandspear #blackpower",141,942,Male,18 - 65+,02/01/17 05:04:17 AM PST,02/02/17 05:04:17 AM PST,https://www.facebook.com/iloveblackexcellence/,Living In: United States,,News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices,,"Martin Luther King, Jr., My Black is Beautiful, Black is beautiful or Black Girls Rock!",,,,,,,,200,RUB,/2017-02/P(1)0004911.pdf,2017-q1.zip,2,,,,,
2477,"Leon Moss, 12, is Atlanta resident. His mother discovered Leon's talent when he was 9-year-old. She began to take him to local museums such as the Apex, the Sights and Sounds Black Cultural Museum and the Fernbank Museum of Natural History. To improve Leon's skills of painting he began to attend art classes of R. Gregory Christies. Non-profit organization the Southwest Atlanta Youth Business Organization (SWAYBO) also helped Leon in many ways. According to blacknews.com, the organization gave him lessons of ""poise and presentation, public speaking, sales and marketing at marketplaces and how to perform basic accounting formulas. With SWAYBO, Leon has met judges, successful business owners and other pillars of the Black community."" Now Moss makes illustrations and sells the copies of his works. The first book with his illustrations is As Big As God. That's what we call the support of family and the community! Good luck, Leon! We should believe in ourselves just like Leon's mother believed in him. Our roots are strong; just imagine how strong you can be if only you grow with your roots!        #blackexcellence #blackperfection #blackbeauty #blackbusiness #africanamerican #blackcommunity #melanin #blackpride #blackout #america #usa #blackscience #education #diversity #leonmoss #art #blackart",268,1827,Male,18 - 65+,02/01/17 05:04:52 AM PST,02/02/17 05:04:52 AM PST,https://www.facebook.com/iloveblackexcellence/,Living In: United States,,News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices,,"Martin Luther King, Jr., My Black is Beautiful, Black is beautiful or Black Girls Rock!",,,,,,,,200,RUB,/2017-02/P(1)0004913.pdf,2017-q1.zip,2,,,,,

""I'm formerly incarcerated, I spent a lot of my childhood in different systems and I had no idea about the beast that communities of color are fighting. My mother didn't know about the school-to-prison pipeline, she just knew she had a black boy."" Coleman explained how his work with wrongfully-convicted clients had shaped his view of the U.S. criminal justice system, which he described as racially lopsided.

If most of the people going into the system are black men, most of my clients will be too."" The Duke Journal of Gender Law and Policy hosted a symposium Tuesday focusing on efforts to improve criminal justice and the American prison system. Titled ""Intersectionality and the Black Lives Matter Movement,"" the event featured a panel of speakers, including James Coleman, John S. Bradway professor of the practice of law, and Umar Muhammad, community organizer for the Southern Coalition for Justice, along with Theresa Newman, clinical professor of law.

2461,"""First and foremost, we as Chicago Public School students would like to thank you for the supportive donation to our schools. As we all know, CPS has been struggling financially, and your donation has really given us a push to get to where we need to be and possibly motivate others to give back to the community as well. This is only one of the many things that you have done to improve our Chicago... All of the things that you do for our city never go unnoticed. All of the free concerts you host and all the time you spend here in the city really show you care. We notice it. We look up to you because the fame usually takes humility away from artists, but it hasn't changed you... We thank you for supporting Chicago's minority youth when not many others have put time to think about the kids. As minority students we feel ignored and as though we don't have enough support from bigger influences like you. Being born and raised in Chicago is not easy at all. There are so many stereotypes and restrictions we have as teenagers due to the frequent violence and crimes. Your music puts some at ease because we know that someone cares and someone has experienced these daily struggles too. You and your music have taught us that you can be true to yourself and still be successful, still be self-made... Once again, thank you for aiding us and giving something back to the city we know and love, Chicago. Sincerely, Alex Rojas, Alondra Cerros, and Annelisse Betancourt Lake View High School Students Chicago, Illinois"" It's not the full letter, but some extracts. It's sweet to observe how young people don't hesitate to express their gratitude and respond to someone who cares for them. We are sure, that Chano needs it. Love should be given back. It should work. As an independent artist he got people's support and Chance didn't forget who made him famous. Artists are made of talent, work and people's love. That's cool that this love goes back and forth! We need more of these positive black people on the media, because some people forget how much love and care black people show. Hopefully one day different race will be the issue of diversity, not stereotypes. #blackexcellence #blackperfection #blackbeauty #blackbusiness #africanamerican #blackcommunity #melanin #blackpride #blackout #america #usa #blackscience #education #diversity #chancetherapper #chicago #music #hiphop #rap",155,1439,All,18 - 65+,03/17/17 07:33:54 AM PDT,03/20/17 10:55:00 AM PDT,https://www.facebook.com/iloveblackexcellence,Living In: United States,,News Feed on desktop computers or News Feed on mobile devices,,"Martin Luther King, Jr., My Black is Beautiful, Black is beautiful or Black Girls Rock!",,,,,,,,200,RUB,/2017-03/P(1)0000842.pdf,2017-q1.zip,3,,,,,

Perez moved to Chicago when he was 8-years- old and was a permanent legal resident. He joined the U.S. Army and served two tours of duty in Afghanistan where he suffered a brain injury in an explosion. Perez served seven years; but because he is not a U.S. citizen, Immigration Customs Enforcement detained him, stripped his legal status and began the deportation process.

2464,"New trends. Often ""new trends"" of American and European cultures is nothing but reinvention of African legacy. People should pay more attention to education and history of things. People should know the origins, not to confuse things. If you want to stress that you use something you taken from another culture it's one thing. But when you wear (for example) dreadlocks and don't know anything about its meaning, it can look strange, even weird. White people do many such things unintentionally. It doesn't make them wise.
